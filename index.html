				<p>I did a website re-design for a pub in Calgary.</p>
				<p><a href="https://richmondspub.com/" target="_blank">Their old website</a> works fine but lacks proper structure and focus.</p>
				<p>I removed the tacky animations, re-organized their content, and went for a more classy look, which pairs well with their logo.</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley's official website</a> is responsive, which means it works on mobile most of the time.</p>
				<p>But they don't have a dedicated mobile version, so I made one with <a href="https://jquerymobile.com/" target="_blank">jQuery Mobile</a>.</p>

				<p>I built an online media focusing on cupcakes in Edmonton.</p>
				<p>Information was gathered around Edmonton's bakeries and sorted into lists.</p>
				<p>The website would be updated consistently for new items coming out.</p>
				<p>I also made a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Edmontons-Best-Cupcake-Bakeries-104730405333660" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> for it as an example to demonstrate social media management.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Even though this was just a hypothetical project, I think it would be practical. The amount of active cupcake specialists in Edmonton guarantees a stable audience.</p>

				<p>I made art assets for steaming, including a webcam frame, alert frame, icons for different alerts, pannel headers, and background.</p>
				<p>They act like "decorations" on a streaming view and support interaction between viewers and the host.</p>
